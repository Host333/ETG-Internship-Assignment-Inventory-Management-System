# ETG-Internship-Assignment-Inventory-Management-System
Here is the Inventory Management System created by me, based on Python 3.
It includes the following features:
1. Add new items to the Inventory (if an existing item is added, then the New Quantity entered will add up with the Original Quantity.)
2. Purchase items; for Customers ( if the Ordered Quantity is more than the Available Quantity, then the Customer will have the option to buy the available quantity or exit.)
3. Update Inventory (the Inventory gets updated as per the orders.)
4. Sales (for every orders the Transaction details are created and saved with every transactions having their Unique Transaction IDs.)
